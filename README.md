Submission to Codetivate hackathon. Green Website with very low carbon emissions.

https://knaagar.github.io/carbonprint/

This site has very low carbon emissions. I tried to create a site which is both green and visually appealing. I hope to spread awareness about **general individual carbon footprint** as well as **digital carbon footprint** which is generally neglected by most.

What have I done to make this site green?
1. I have used no images (not even a favicon) because images are a lot of data.
2. The whole file size is 28 kB.
3. No server (because was not required).
4. Tried to use less JS.
5. Used only one custom font and used web safe fonts.
6. Clean code

All these things help the website to load faster and emit less carbon emissions and energy.
